# LangChain: A Comprehensive Guide to Theory and Practice

LangChain is an open-source framework for developing applications that connect **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with external data sources, tools, APIs, and memory. It provides a modular architecture that enables developers to build powerful, flexible AI applications powered by LLMs.

This guide covers the most important theoretical foundations and offers practical examples for effectively using LangChain in real-world projects.

## 1. Introduction to LangChain

LangChain was created to free LLMs from isolated operation and allow them to access real-time information, structured data, external tools, and contextual memory. It enables developers to build applications that integrate LLMs with:

- Vector databases (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, Qdrant)  
- APIs and custom tools  
- Knowledge bases or document storage  
- Conversation memory and chat history

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### LLMs

LangChain supports integration with external models via OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, and more.

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo")
```

### Chains

Chains connect multiple steps into a logical pipeline. Example: input → prompt → model → output.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Question: {question}\nAnswer:")
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
result = chain.run("What is LangChain?")
```

### Prompts

Prompt templates with variables that can be dynamically filled and passed to LLMs.

### Tools

Custom functions or external APIs that an agent can call during execution.

### Agents

Autonomous entities that can decide what actions to take and in what order using reasoning.

### Memory

Enables conversational applications to retain chat history and contextual state.

### Callbacks / Tracing

Used for logging, monitoring, and visualizing execution steps (e.g., via LangSmith).

## 3. Installation and Setup

```bash
pip install langchain openai chromadb
```

For LangSmith integration:
```bash
pip install langsmith
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your-key
```

---

## 4. Basic Examples

### Simple Q&A with Prompt Template
```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("What is the meaning of {topic}?")
llm = OpenAI()
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
print(chain.run("AI"))
```

---

## 5. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### Load and Split Documents
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
loader = TextLoader("document.txt")
documents = loader.load()
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)
chunks = splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

### Store Embeddings with Chroma
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(chunks, OpenAIEmbeddings())
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()
```

### RetrievalQA Chain
```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(llm=llm, retriever=retriever)
qa_chain.run("What does the document say about digital transformation?")
```

---

## 6. Working with Tools and Agents

### Define a Tool
```python
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def double_number(number: str) -> str:
    return str(2 * int(number))
```

### Initialize Agent
```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, AgentType
agent = initialize_agent([double_number], llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION)
agent.run("Double 12")
```

---

## 7. Advanced Workflows with LangGraph

LangGraph enables stateful, multi-step workflows with branching logic and memory. 
Useful for multi-turn conversations, role-based agents, or iterative refinement workflows.

---

## 8. Debugging and Monitoring with LangSmith

LangSmith provides observability tools for tracing, evaluating, and comparing LLM runs.

```python
import langsmith
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_PROJECT"] = "my-project"
```

---

## 9. Best Practices

- Test and version prompt templates systematically  
- Validate LLM outputs where correctness matters  
- Use memory only when context retention is essential  
- Structure modular chains for reuse and clarity  
- Leverage LangSmith for debugging and experimentation
